# Genetic-Algorithm
This repo is a simple example of how to implement a genetic algorithm using c# and generics. In this case we implement the genetic algorithm so that our applications learns to 
write a phrase we specify.

## Steps
- Create intial population
- Calculate the fitness value
- Selection
- Crossover
- Mutation
- Repeat process until criteria is satisfied
